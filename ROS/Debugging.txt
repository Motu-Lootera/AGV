Roscore Error
	DESCRIPTION: roscore cannot run as another roscore/master is already running.

	SOLUTION:  
			$ killall -9 roscore
Check if a new roscore is running now.
(OPTIONAL)	$ killall -9 rosmaster 

	DESCRIPTION: run_id on parameter server does not match declared run_id: cb4152e0-e323-11e9-aa64-b4b686d19426.
