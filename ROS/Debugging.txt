Cmake Error 
	DESCRIPTION: CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.5/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:367 (message):
  	A required package was not found

  	SOLUTION: $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

      '-r'  
Given code installs all the dependencies required by the packages in src.

Roscore Error
	DESCRIPTION: roscore cannot run as another roscore/master is already running. 
	Please kill other roscore/master processes before relaunching.

	Prospective Reasons: 1. If you roslaunch without running a roscore from before, then run another roscore after killing it.

	SOLUTION:  
			$ killall -9 roscore
Check if a new roscore is running now.
(OPTIONAL)	$ killall -9 rosmaster
